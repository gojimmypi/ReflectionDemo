# ReflectionDemo 

This example shows an external class library in a completely separate project DLL, accessing all of the main app methods and variables.

[ReflectionDemo](https://github.com/gojimmypi/ReflectionDemo/tree/master/ReflectionDemo) is the main app.

[BlackBox](https://github.com/gojimmypi/ReflectionDemo/tree/master/BlackBox) is the external DLL class library.

Latest update includes ability to view source code programmatically, as well as view stackframe info for each method. Thanks [@ITMayWorkDev](https://twitter.com/ITMayWorkDev/status/1020994049799405568)

Unresolved: peeking at local variable values.
